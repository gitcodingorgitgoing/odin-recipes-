</p>


<p><h1>Ingredients:</h1></p>

<p><h2>For the Kibbe filling:</h2></p>

<ul>


  <li>500 g minced meat</li>
 <li>2-3 onions chopped</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon 7 spice</li>
 <li>1.5 tablespoon Kibbeh Spices (Kamouneh Spice Mix)</li>
 <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
 <li> 1 tablespoon salt</li>
  <li>1 cup chopped walnuts or pine nuts</li>
  <li>2 tablespoon sumac</li>

</ul>


<p><h2>For the Kibbe casing:</h2></p>

<ul>


<li>1 kilo fine bulgur wheat
 <li>1 kilo mince meat
  <li> onions
 <li>1.5 tablespoon Kibbeh Spices
 <li>1.5 tablespoon cornflour
  <li>1 teaspoon 7 spice
  <li>½ teaspoon black pepper
 <li> 1 tablespoon salt
 <li> Sunflower or vegetable oil

</ul>


<p><h1>Instructions:</h1></p>

<p><ol>



 <li><p>Soak the bulgur wheat in enough water to cover and set aside</p></li>

 <li><p>To make the filling, sauté the chopped onions in regular olive oil until golden on medium low heat</p></li>

 <li><p>Add 500g of minced meat to the onions and cook out the meat on medium high heat</p></li>

  <li><p>Add the 7 spice, kamouneh spices, black pepper and salt and use the back of your wooden spoon to break up the mea</p></li>

  <li><p>When it is cooked turn off the heat and add the sumac and chopped walnuts. Taste to make any adjustments then cover and set aside</p></li>

  <li><p>Drain the bulgur wheat and add to a large bowl. Take out the kilo of meat and prepare food processor</p></li>

  <li><p>In several batches, add the bulgur wheat and equal amounts of meat to the food processor and process until it clumps together and starts to roll in the processor bowl.</p></li>

  <li><p>Roughly chop 2 onions to go in the food processor along with the 7 spices, kamouneh spices, black pepper and salt. Blitz well</p></li>

 <li><p>When you have combined all the meat and bulgur wheat in a bowl, add the blitzed onion spice mix and the cornflour, then bring everything together preferably with your hands</p></li>


 <li><p>If it is too dry add a bit of water, you don't want it too loose, sticky or crumbly but so it holds together nicely. If you don't mind tasting a bit of raw meat check a tiny bit for saltiness and adjust as necessary</p></li>


 <li> <p>Add approx half a cup of sunflower to a small bowl which you can dip your fingers into when shaping the kibbeh to avoid sticking. Clean your table and arrange a workflow with a large clean tray, the sunflower oil, the filling and the casing mix</p> </li>


 <li><p>Take some casing and roll into golf ball size, indent the middle then hollow out the inside with your index finger turning as you do so until you have a half shell. Add a spoon of filling and close up the casing. Compress well with your hands and shape into classic kibbeh morsels (see video)</p> </li>


  <li><p>Line up the kibbeh on the tray until you finish the filling</p> </li>


  <li><p>Deep fry your kibbeh morsels in sunflower or vegetable oil and serve with yoghurt dip</p> </li>
