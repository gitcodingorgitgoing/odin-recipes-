</h3></p>

<p><h1>Ingredients:</h1></p>

<p><ul>
 <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
 <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
 <li>1 tablespoon whole grain mustard</li>
 <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
 <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
 <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
 <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
 <li>6 ounces baby red potatoes, halved</li>
 <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
 <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
 <li>1 lemon, thinly sliced</li>
 <li>tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
  
  
  
  
  </ul></p>


<p><h1>Instructions:</h1></p>


<p><ol>

 <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
  <li>In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons olive oil, mustards, thyme, rosemary and lemon zest; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Cut four sheets of foil, about 12-inches long. Divide potatoes into 4 equal portions and add to the center of each foil in a single layer.</li>
 <li> Fold up all 4 sides of each foil packet. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper, to taste; gently toss to combine.</li>
 <li>Top each packet with the chicken. Using your fingers or a brush, work the mustard mixture onto both sides of the chicken. Top with lemon slices.</li>
 <li>Fold the sides of the foil over the chicken, covering completely and sealing the packets closed. Place foil packets in a single layer on a baking sheet. Place into oven and bake until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are tender, about 25-30 minutes.*</li>
 <p>OPTIONAL: Preheat oven to broil. Open the packets and broil for 2-3 minutes, or until caramelized and slightly charred.
  Served immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.</p></li>
